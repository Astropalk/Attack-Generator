# Attack-Generator
# This files generates different Deductive and Additive type of attack in power consumption values in smart meters of homes. The aim of attacks is to manipulate the learned threshold that recognize noises , uncertainties and attack in the system.
#I generated these different attack type in a time series data set to find the weakness of ML/AI algorithm used to detect anomalies int the systems. Based on my finings, I can make more robust and resilient ML/AI algorithm.
